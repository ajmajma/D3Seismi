#D3 Seismi Map

Install dependancies and 

     grunt server

to run in localhost:9000


I do not have a great amount of time to commit to this - here are my notes

TODO:

    more karma tests - testing has been set up 
    set up node/express to call to seismi's api
    expand on/add more custom filtering
    more user interaction
    more custom styling
    better/more interesting feedback when clicked
    deal with overlapping points
    add in more custom animations ngAnimate and/or velocity.js
    work on general layout/UI/UX

I wanted to play around with angular-material so I tried it out here - i was hoping to find more ways to use it ( like the typeahead based on the current object or the selects - however the selects still are still not live), hopefully more in the future.

I would love to try to translate this to a 3d map like http://boydgreenfield.com/quakes/ , or even establish relationships via depth or magnitude with something like this - http://bl.ocks.org/dwtkns/4973620 .
